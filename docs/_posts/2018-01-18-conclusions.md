# Things that could appear here:

1. Real-life application of RL. What should be done so RL will become a technology. Which sould lead us to:
2. Beyond MDP: even if there is some underlying MDP, less than perfect observations ruins it (see what happened in the discretization case). So we would like to find a solution for non-MDP models.
3. Easy and hard exploration: what we didnâ€™t cover at all (Montezuma's Revenge).
4. The Reduction of Multi-Agent problem (Go, Pong) to single agent vs. environment:
    1. Can make the learning easier (gradually increasing difficulty)
    2. Approximation of the MiniMax solution?
5. Proofs and deductive justifications: Q-learning, P-learning, Alpha-Go.
